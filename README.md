Lightweight file manager focusing as a file/code viewer with syntax highlighting

## Description

Simple File Manager allows you to swiftly browse through the directories and files in your WordPress installation. A good alternative for [File Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-file-manager/), [Filester - File Manager Pro](https://wordpress.org/plugins/filester/), [Advanced File Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/file-manager-advanced/) if your primary focus is viewing directory content and the code in files for your dev work. 

At v1.0.0, this plugin primarily works as a code viewer for WordPress core, theme and plugin files. It uses [prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) to highlight code syntax in files commonly used throughout the WordPress development cycle such as PHP, HTML, Javascript, CSS, JSON and Markdown.

Simple File Manager is based on the [Simple File Manager](https://github.com/jcampbell1/simple-file-manager) library by [John Campbell](https://github.com/jcampbell1).
